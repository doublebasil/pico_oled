Cut out the middle of the loading donut

Move the loading circle bitmap pushing code out into it's own module
scope function

Add a loading circle colour changing function, which using the loading circle
bitmap pushing function?

Add the border thing to the horizontal loading bar. The border should be
drawn in the init function and should be untouched by the display function
Add border to loading circle? Or just don't

Make sure all the bitmap setting functions don't set values outside of the 
calloc boundary. Also make sure we aren't using any negative indexes for the
bitmap pointers

Add image support

Neaten the oled_test function, make the gradients use the display dimensions
in the calculations

Add QR generation

Add extra loading bar functions, so we'll have
oled_roundLoadingBarInit
oled_roundLoadingBarUpdate
oled_roundLoadingBarEnd
Init will malloc a bitmap, so that the update only has to update
the pixels that have changed
End will free the bitmap
Although, might be a bit over the top for a simple loading bar
And might have to malloc quite a bit of memory
By the time you've done all the bitwise operations with the bitmap
I'm not sure I'll be much better off in terms of speed

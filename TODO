Make the horizontal loading bar use a bitmap

Add the border thing to the horizontal loading bar. The border should be
drawn in the init function and should be untouched by the display function

Add round loading bar using bitmap. Need to use bitmap
else you get nasty flashing :(

Neaten the oled_test function, make the gradients use the display dimensions
in the calculations

Add QR generation

There are some methods that'd be more suitable than setPixel in the 
manufacturers code, which would be more efficient

Add image support

Add extra loading bar functions, so we'll have
oled_roundLoadingBarInit
oled_roundLoadingBarUpdate
oled_roundLoadingBarEnd
Init will malloc a bitmap, so that the update only has to update
the pixels that have changed
End will free the bitmap
Although, might be a bit over the top for a simple loading bar
And might have to malloc quite a bit of memory
By the time you've done all the bitwise operations with the bitmap
I'm not sure I'll be much better off in terms of speed
